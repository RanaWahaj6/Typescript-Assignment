//Question
//Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. If you don’t have anything
// specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, 
//just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence describing what the program does.
var Myname = "Muhammad Wahaj";
var Todaydate = "06-july-2023";
console.log(Myname + "\n" + Todaydate + "\n" + "I learn how to add comments in this program.");
