//               question
//Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them.
// The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name
var Name = ["Wahaj", "Hamza", "Ali", "Hassan"];
for (var index = 0; index < Name.length; index++) {
    console.log("Wow! Nice to see you " + Name[index]);
}
